index.html files are the easiest so I didn't spend time making it

the CSS file wasn't so much a hassle as I didn't spend too much time on it because the challenge was the javascript

the javascript was by far the deal breaker for me because not only did it involve multiple methods of either trying to use local storage and an API I kept both methods on different branches as it was easier for me to manage

I have 2 versions of the project 
- 1 that works that's deployed
- 1 that is in a branch and I attempted to work on that was initially for the project


-- Deployed Version -- 

----- This version took me 2 days to make but it all was based on how I wanted everything to work because I like to know what means what and then make a note of what it does or what it's used for. I only have a bug and that bug is that it deletes whenever I delete one item, I will revisit this project and fix those issues because I really want to make this project work.

-- The Non-Deployed Version | The API way --

----- This was probably the most difficult task that I have encountered when coding because it was so new to me that I didn't know where to look for info, thankfully my mentor helped me out, he gave me a boost in the right direction but I wasn't able to finish the job as I couldn't find the right info that would help me but I won't let that L get to me because I will come back and finish this project out the right way.
