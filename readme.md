index.html files are the easiest so I didn't spend time making it

the CSS file wasn't so much a hassle as I didn't spend too much time on it because the challenge was the javascript

the javascript was by far the deal breaker for me because not only did it involve multiple methods of either trying to use local storage and an API I kept both methods on different branches as it was easier for me to manage

I have 2 versions of the project 
- 1 that works that's deployed
- 1 that is in a branch and I attempted to work on that was initially for the project


-- Deployed Version --
